###[398]. Random Pick Index
[Medium]
```
Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:

int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);
```

> // randomly select an int from 0 to the nums of target. If x equals 0, set the res as the current index.   
> The probability is always 1/nums for the latest appeared number. For example, 1 for 1st num, 1/2 for 2nd num, 1/3 for 3nd num (1/2 * 2/3 for each of the first 2 nums).

        int res = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == target) {
                int x = rand.nextInt(++total); 
                res = x == 0 ? i : res;
